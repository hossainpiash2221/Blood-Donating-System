Introduction
 1.1 Overview
 Theblooddonating systemwasconstructed for finding blood donors easily. This project
 provides search facilities for blood groups and finds their address and contact number.
 Its also provide multiple route from patient to donors also minimum distance from donor
 to patient. It can be used to add new donor information. If any patient will need any
 blood group then they will be finding a lot of blood donors by using this system whose
 blood groups are the same as the patient. And also patients can request blood that they
 need and the first patient will be given first as soon as possible.The recipient can see
 how far away the donor is. In this project, we tried to implement counting the distance
 from the source.we tried to make such an interface that It works like a family doctor.
 1.2 Motivation
 There can be several motivations for creating this project. Some of them are:
 • The blood donating system project simplifies the blood finding and donating.
 • System for individual donors and acceptors.
 • Here can be added multiple donor information like blood group, contact informa
tion, health condition, etc.
 • Users can find their needed donor as their recommendation.
 • If any donor put his wrong information and need to change contact number, ad
dress,And any other else.
 • Thentheycanupdateordelete their information and authority can restore the data
 from trash file.
 • Patients can see who is near by him with their distance.
 • If anyone want they can count short path form the source in this system.

• The aim of this project is to save the lives by provides blood to those has need to
 blood in emergency situation.
 • Create an user friendly interface for both the donor and patients.
 1.3 Problem Definition
 1.3.1 Problem Statement
 The problem of the ’ blood donating system’ project solves is the lack of a user friendly
 managementsystemthatsimplifiesInefficient Inventory Management, Inadequate Donor
 Management,Ineffective Donor-Recipient Matching, Reporting and Analytical Chal
lenges, and Security and Privacy Risks in this system. Users face difficulties in dynami
cally managing custom locations.Real-time updates and the absence of a comprehensive
 shortest path calculation further impede the system’s effectiveness.also,there is no con
tacting options between donor and acceptor and no advise option for both. The problem
 statement summarises the requirement for an enhanced user interface to address these
 issues and raise the system dispatch operations’ general effectiveness and responsive
ness.
